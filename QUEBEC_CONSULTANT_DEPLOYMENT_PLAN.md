## 🏛️ Phase 1: Legal Structure & Registration

### 1.1 Choose Legal Form

| Feature | **Sole Proprietorship** (Enterprise Individuelle) | **Incorporation** (Société par actions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Low (~$39 CAD registration) | High (~$356 + legal fees) |
| **Liability** | Unlimited personal liability | Limited liability |
| **Taxation** | Personal income tax rates | Corporate tax rates |
| **Complexity** | Minimal paperwork | Annual declarations, minute books |

> **Recommendation**: Start as a **Sole Proprietorship** for simplicity if revenue is under $30k-$50k initially. Switch to Incorporation once liability risks increase or tax advantages become viable (typically >$80k net income).

### 1.2 Register with the Registraire des entreprises (REQ)

*Mandatory if you operate under a name other than your own exact first and last name.*

1. **Access Portal**: Go to [Registraire des entreprises](https://www.quebec.ca/entreprises-et-travailleurs-autonomes/demarrer-entreprise/immatriculer-constituer-entreprise).
2. **Service**: Select "Immatriculer une personne physique" (for Sole Prop).
3. **Info Needed**:
    - Social Insurance Number (SIN).
    - Business address (can be home address).
    - Business activities (Consulting/Conseils).
4. **Outcome**: You will receive a **NEQ** (Numéro d'entreprise du Québec).

---

## 💰 Phase 2: Taxation & Finance

### 2.1 GST & QST Registration

*Mandatory if worldwide taxable sales > $30,000 in a calendar year.*

- **Federal**: GST (5%)
- **Provincial**: QST (9.975%)
- **Registration**: [Revenu Québec - Register for Tax Files](https://www.revenuquebec.ca/en/businesses/consumption-taxes/gsthst-and-qst/registering-for-the-gsthst-and-qst/)
- **Note**: Even if under $30k, voluntary registration allows you to claim Input Tax Credits (ITCs) on business expenses (laptops, software, home office).

### 2.2 Banking

* Open a dedicated **Business Bank Account**.
- **Do not** mix personal and business funds.
- **Bank Recommendations**: Desjardins, NBC (National Bank), or RBC often have low-fee simplified accounts for consultants.

### 2.3 Income Tax Installments

* Be prepared that after your first year, Revenu Québec and CRA may require **quarterly tax installments** based on the previous year's earnings. Set aside ~25-30% of gross revenue for taxes.

## ⚡ Phase 3: Operations & Compliance

### 3.1 Bill 96 & Language Laws

Quebec has strict French language laws.
- **Contracts**: Standard contracts must be in French unless the client explicitly requests English. *Best practice: Have a "Language Clause" where the client opts for English.*
- **Website**: Must be available in French. (Vayne Consultations should have a FR toggle).
- **Software/OS**: Businesses must ensure work software is available in French if employees are hired.

### 3.2 Permits & Zoning

* **Home Office**: Generally permitted for consulting. Check municipal bylaws if you plan to have clients visit your home (often restricted).
- **Permit Tools**: Use [PerLE](https://services.bizpal-perle.ca/) to check for specific municipal permits.

### 3.3 Insurance

* **Commercial General Liability (CGL)**: Protects against "slip and fall" or accidental damage to client property.
- **Professional Liability (E&O)**: *Critical for consultants.* Protects against claims of negligence or bad advice causing financial loss to the client.
