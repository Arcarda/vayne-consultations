offer_angle: >
  An interior designer's website is their most visible work. A site that loads
  slowly or buries the portfolio communicates the opposite of what their brand
  promises. Vayne Consulting creates digital spaces as curated as the physical
  ones they design.

analysis_focus: >
  Portfolio accessibility, image performance, lead capture mechanisms, and
  service clarity. Flag any studio relying solely on Instagram or PDF portfolios.

outreach_angle: >
  Your work speaks for itself — your website should too. Right now, the gap
  between the quality of your projects and the quality of your digital presence
  may be costing you premium clients.
