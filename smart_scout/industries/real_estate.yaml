offer_angle: >
  In real estate, perception is everything. A generic template website
  positions a high-performing agent the same as a newcomer. Vayne Consulting
  builds branded presences that communicate expertise before the first call —
  turning passive browsers into qualified leads.

analysis_focus: >
  Brand differentiation vs. template sites, lead capture mechanisms,
  neighborhood positioning, and transaction social proof. Flag any agent
  using a corporate franchise template with no personal brand layer.

outreach_angle: >
  Every other agent in your market is using the same template. The ones
  winning the listing appointments are the ones whose digital presence
  communicates 'specialist', not 'generalist'.
