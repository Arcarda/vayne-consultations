offer_angle: >
  A law firm's website is its first argument. A weak digital presence signals
  disorganization before the file is even opened. Vayne Consulting repositions
  boutique firms as credible, modern, and approachable — without sacrificing authority.

  Trust signals, booking friction, practice area clarity, bilingual readiness,
  and mobile performance. Prioritize any firm with phone-only contact or a
  non-responsive layout.

  something only you can say — and make it effortless for a stressed client
  to take the next step.
