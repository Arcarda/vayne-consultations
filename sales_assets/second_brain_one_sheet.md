# Your Firm Has Amnesia.
## Stop Searching. Start Knowing.

### The Problem: The "10,000 PDF" Trap
Your firm has generated massive value over the last decade. It sits in:
*   Thousands of case files and contracts.
*   Endless email chains.
*   Buried research reports.

When a junior associate needs to know *"How did we structure the deal for Client X in 2019?"*, they don't ask the database. They interrupt a Partner. Or worse, they reinvent the wheel, wasting billable hours and risking inconsistency.

**Your firm's collective intelligence is fragmented, offline, and leaking.**

### The Solution: The Corporate Second Brain
We deploy a **private, secure, air-gapped Intelligence Engine** directly into your infrastructure. It ingests your entire history—every PDF, DOCX, and Email—and makes it instantly queryable via natural language.

#### 1. Zero Data Leakage
Unlike ChatGPT, your data **never** leaves your control. We use local, open-source Large Language Models (LLM) running on your hardware or a private, isolated cloud instance. **Privacy is the default.**

#### 2. Instant Recall
*   *"Draft a response to this objection based on our 2023 litigation strategy."*
*   *"Summarize every interaction we've had with [Industry] clients in the last 5 years."*
*   **Result**: 3 hours of research done in 3 seconds.

#### 3. Citations You Can Trust
The system doesn't hallucinate. It cites its sources. Every answer includes a direct link to the original document in your file system.
