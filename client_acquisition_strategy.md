## 1. The Philosophy: "Be So Good They Find You"

We do not chase clients. We post high-value evidence of our work, and let the clients come to us.

* **The Hook:** "I don't need to pitch you. My work speaks for itself."
* **The Mechanism:** High-visibility "Before & After" case studies.

## 2. The Passive Pillars

### A. The "Open Source" Audit

Instead of emailing people errors, we engage in public "Fixes."

* **Strategy:** Find a popular tool/site with bad UX. Redesign one key feature.
* **Action:** Post the redesign on Dribbble/Twitter/Reddit with a breakdown of *why* it works better.
* **Result:** Potential clients see your expertise without you asking for anything.

### B. The SEO "Honey Pot"

Capture traffic from people already looking for help.

* **Keywords:** "Streamer branding kit", "SaaS landing page redesign", "clean minimal web design".
* **Content:** Write 3 detailed guides on the Vayne site (e.g., *"Why your dark mode looks muddy and how to fix it"*).

### C. The "Signature" Footer

* **Strategy:** Every site you touch gets a "Designed by Vayne" link in the footer.
* **Growth:** One client leads to three more passively.

## 3. The "Soft" Signal (Low Stakes Entry)

When you *do* interact, it's helpful, not salesy.

**The "Helpful Observer" Script**
(Only sent if you genuinely spot a critical error)

> "Hey [Name], just heads up - your checkout button is broken on mobile Safari. I ran into it while browsing. Just wanted to let you know so you don't lose sales! Love what you're building."
>
> *[No pitch. No ask. Just value. If they reply, they reply.]*

## 4. Execution Plan (The "Gardening" Phase)

| Day | Action | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mon** | **Build:** Create a "Before/After" visual of a generic SaaS header. | Portfolio asset. |
| **Tue** | **Write:** Draft one blog post: "The 3 things that kill conversion." | SEO Signal. |
| **Wed** | **Refine:** Polish the existing Vayne site to be Portfolio-perfect. | Trust Signal. |
| **Thu** | **Social:** Post the "Before/After" to a design forum/subreddit. | Traffic. |
| **Fri** | **Rest:** Let the seeds grow. | Passive mode. |

## 5. Pricing Psychology

*   **Never say:** "I charge $50/hour." (Commodity)
*   **Always say:** "The Re-Branding Package is a flat **$1,500**." (Product)
    *   Includes: Strategy Session, Logo Refresh, High-Impact Landing Page, 1 Month Support.

## 6. The Upsell Path (Tier 2/3)

If the client asks for "Booking Systems," "User Accounts," or "Complex Security":

*   **Pivot:** "That moves us into **The Bespoke Launch** territory. We start at **$3,500** for custom architecture."
*   **Logic:** The $1,500 package is the *entry point*. It filters serious clients from tire-kickers. Once they trust you with the Re-Brand, upsell the ecosystem.
