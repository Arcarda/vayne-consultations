# The Corporate Second Brain

## Private AI Knowledge Base for Professional Firms

---

> **"Stop searching. Start asking."**
>
> Transform your firm's scattered documents into an intelligent, searchable knowledge base that answers questions in plain English.

---

## The Problem

Your team wastes **2+ hours per day** searching through:

- Old emails buried in inboxes
- PDFs scattered across shared drives  
- Notes from meetings no one remembers
- Client files from 3 years ago

When a partner asks *"What did we quote Client X in 2023?"* — it shouldn't take 45 minutes to find out.

---

## The Solution

**A private, secure AI assistant that knows your firm's history.**

We deploy a custom knowledge base that:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Ingests all your documents** | PDFs, Word docs, emails, spreadsheets — unified |
| **Answers questions instantly** | "Find all contracts mentioning liability caps" |
| **Runs on YOUR servers** | Data never leaves your control |
| **Learns your terminology** | Custom-trained on your firm's language |
| **Available 24/7** | No waiting for someone to "check the files" |
