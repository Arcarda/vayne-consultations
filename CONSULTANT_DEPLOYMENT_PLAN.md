## 📅 Executive Summary

This document serves as the master deployment guide for launching **Vayne Consulting**. It covers valid legal structures, mandatory registrations, tax compliance, and operational requirements.

---

## 🏛️ Phase 1: Legal Structure & Registration

### 1.1 Choose Legal Form

| Feature | **Sole Proprietorship** (Enterprise Individuelle) | **Incorporation** (Société par actions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Low (~$39 CAD registration) | High (~$356 + legal fees) |
| **Liability** | Unlimited personal liability | Limited liability |
| **Taxation** | Personal income tax rates | Corporate tax rates |
| **Complexity** | Minimal paperwork | Annual declarations, minute books |

> **Recommendation**: Start as a **Sole Proprietorship** for simplicity if revenue is under $30k-$50k initially. Switch to Incorporation once liability risks increase or tax advantages become viable (typically >$80k net income).

### 1.2 Register with the Registraire des entreprises (REQ)

*Mandatory if you operate under a name other than your own exact first and last name.*

1. **Access Portal**: Go to [Registraire des entreprises](https://www.quebec.ca/entreprises-et-travailleurs-autonomes/demarrer-entreprise/immatriculer-constituer-entreprise).
2. **Service**: Select "Immatriculer une personne physique" (for Sole Prop).
3. **Info Needed**:
    - Tax ID / Social Security Number.
    - Business address.
    - Business activities (Consulting).
4. **Outcome**: You will receive a Business Registration Number.

## 💰 Phase 2: Taxation & Finance

### 2.1 GST & QST Registration

*Mandatory if worldwide taxable sales > $30,000 in a calendar year.*

- **Federal**: GST (5%)
- **Provincial**: QST (9.975%)
- **Registration**: Register with local tax authorities for sales tax/VAT if applicable.
- **Note**: Voluntary registration often allows you to claim credits on business expenses (laptops, software, home office).

### 2.2 Banking

- Open a dedicated **Business Bank Account**.

- **Do not** mix personal and business funds.
- **Bank Recommendations**: Desjardins, NBC (National Bank), or RBC often have low-fee simplified accounts for consultants.

### 2.3 Income Tax Installments

- Be prepared that after your first year, tax authorities may require **quarterly tax installments** based on the previous year's earnings. Set aside ~25-30% of gross revenue for taxes.

## ⚡ Phase 3: Operations & Compliance

### 3.1 Language & Localization

- **Contracts**: Ensure contracts are in the primary language of commerce for the region.
- **Website**: maintain localization support as needed for target demographic.

### 3.2 Permits & Zoning

- **Home Office**: Generally permitted for consulting. Check municipal bylaws if you plan to have clients visit your home (often restricted).

- **Permit Tools**: Use [PerLE](https://services.bizpal-perle.ca/) to check for specific municipal permits.

### 3.3 Insurance

- **Commercial General Liability (CGL)**: Protects against "slip and fall" or accidental damage to client property.

- **Professional Liability (E&O)**: *Critical for consultants.* Protects against claims of negligence or bad advice causing financial loss to the client.
